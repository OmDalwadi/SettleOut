                                    Problem Description:

The problem of adjustment and integration for international students moving to a new city or country is a significant concern. The process of settling into a new environment can be challenging as they must navigate unfamiliar cultural norms, language barriers, and bureaucratic procedures. Furthermore, students may face difficulties in finding appropriate housing,
employment, and other essential resources, which can negatively impact their ability to establish a sense of security and stability. These challenges can lead to feelings of isolation and anxiety, which can negatively impact academic performance and overall well-being. Our project, ”SettleOut: The Newcomer’s
Navigator” aims to address these issues by providing support and
resources to international students as they navigate the challenges of settling into a new environment. Our platform allows students to search for and connect with alumni and current students who serve as agents to provide guidance and support in navigating the challenges of adjusting to a new
culture, finding housing, transportation, and other practical needs. Additionally, the website will provide resources and information to help students prepare for their move, such as information on visa requirements, cost of living, and cultural customs.

                                       Conclusion:
SettleOut is a unique and innovative platform that addresses a significant need for international students. With the development of a user-friendly website, a database of agents, and resources and information to assist students in their transition, SettleOut is poised to make a significant impact
on the international student community. We look forward to the successful launch and implementation of this project.
